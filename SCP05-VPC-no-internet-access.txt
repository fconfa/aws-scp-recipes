This SCP prevents users or roles in any affected account from changing the configuration of your Amazon EC2 virtual private clouds (VPCs) to grant them direct access to the internet. It doesn't block existing direct access or any access that routes through your on-premises network environment.

The SCP limits intenet connectivity through the following:

* Prevents attaching IPv4 and IPv6 Internet Gateways (IGW) to allow direct internet access to the VPC.
* Prevents creating VPC Peering connections which might allow indirect internet access through another VPC that has it.
* Prevents modifications of Global Accelerator configuration which can allow internet access to private VPC resources directly.
